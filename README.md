# react-api-integration
Its a very small app which i created using React while practicing API integration in react. In this user can add the movies and fetch the movies.

For storing the movies details I used firebase.

By sending the GET request to firebase user can get the movies from db and with POST request we are seding the details to firebase.

If anybody want to run this project on there system they have to download the project and run npm install command it will install the dependencies.
